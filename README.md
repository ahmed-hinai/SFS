# SFS - Show Fan Speeds

SFS is a TUI for nbfc-linux I made while learning C. I personally wanted an alternative for Acer NitroSense working on linux as I just like to monitor my fan speeds :).  


## Features

- **Fan speed monitor**
- **A keybind to set fan speed target to max/auto**
- **Temperature and utilization monitor**
